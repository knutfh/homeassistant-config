# Home Assistant configuration

This is my [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) configuration.

I run HassOS under Proxmox on an old laptop. Proxmox also hosts an Ubuntu VM that runs Docker to host Caddy and some other utilities.

- [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) as a reverse proxy.
- [BlueIris](https://blueirissoftware.com) for surveillance.
- [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com) to store sensor data from Home Assistant.
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com) to visualise all of that data.
- [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io) to manage my Docker environment.
