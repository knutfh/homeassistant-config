# Home Assistant configuration

This is my [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) configuration.

I'm running Ubuntu 16.04.4 (Xenial) on an old laptop, and have installed [Hass.io](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/). 
I'm running a slew of different services in the same Docker environment, and use [Portainer](https://portainer.io) to manage it all.

- [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) as a reverse proxy.
- [BlueIris](https://blueirissoftware.com) for surveillance.
- [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com) to store sensor data from Home Assistant.
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com) to visualise all of that data.
- [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io) to manage my Docker environment.
